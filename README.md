Fall In Hackathon
### AI Prompt Used
https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/ymSoJoRypiNfS4hZ1QzVHhld?model=text-davinci-003
- Data can be hardcoded or sent with data from a table.
- OpenAI Key in code is invalid; you must change .env to include your personal key
### AI Issues
- response does not always meet formatting requirements. An error detection functionality will need to be implemented to restructure and/or submit another request.
## Future Updates
- connect Open AI to database procedures, directly, vastly decreasing server times, rendering speed, and memory
-  Add a linked-in to populate data
-  Replace VA website link with  sites recommended by OpenAi
-  Add an ability to add your own hobbies.
